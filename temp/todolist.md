Flip-Mirror-Rotate: An architecture for bit-write reduction and wear leveling in non-volatile memories|RNW operates at cache line granularity since most data transactions between the last level cache and the main memory are in units of cache lines, either due to ‘write-through’ or cache evictions. Hence, all the words in a cache line are subjected to the same access patterns. This implies that for any intra-word wear leveling scheme, it is sufficient to maintain a common set of tag bits for all words in the cache line.
