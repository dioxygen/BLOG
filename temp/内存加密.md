[云环境下内存数据完整性验证方法](http://www.cs.utah.edu/wondp/gundu.pdf)，里面提到Memory authentication provides a guarantee to the user that the value returned by a memory read request is exactly the last value that was written to that address. In spite of several recent innovations, state-of-theart memory authentication continues to pose a high bandwidth overhead of 6X. This is especially problematic for the multi-core memory-intensive workloads that are so popular in the big-data era.
