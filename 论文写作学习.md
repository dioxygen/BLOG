1. Main Memory Write Traffic (WT) and Compression Ratio (CR) of the accessed data are used to categorize the workloads. Applications with WT>1 GB=S are called MemoryIntensive (MI); Not-Memory-Intensive (NMI) applications are those with WT<1 GB=S. Workloads with CR>4 are categorized as Highly-Compressible (HC), while applications with 2<CR<4 are known as Moderately-Compressible (CM); finally, applications with CR<2 are considered as Poorly-Compressible (PC).
1. More clearly, we devise a compression based selective encryption scheme along with data rotation unit to achieve both the security and uniformity in cell usage.
1. Fig. 13b shows the bit-flip distribution in CryptoComp with ETH=48, 32 and 16. As can been seen, systems with ETH=48, 32 are always better than HWL whereas ETH = 16 needs to select a POISE value larger than 25 percent to attain a more uniform distribution.
1. In many respects, non-volatile memories (NVMs) are considered as promising alternatives for traditional DRAMand SRAM-based memory systems. However, due to the short lifetime and security vulnerability of NVMs, replacing DRAM and SRAM with NVM causes some problems. We proposed CryptoComp to improve the security and lifetime of a phase change main memory by adopting a selectiveencryption scheme working on compressed memory blocks.
1. For words whose “modified” bit is set or reset, the decryption is performed using PAD-LCR or PAD-TCR, respectively. 
1. Swamietal propose a technique which extends the size of encryption counters to reduce the frequency of counter overflow and subsequent re-encryption.
